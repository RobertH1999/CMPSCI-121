"""Problem 2:
Describe a function that would accept 7 values from the function call and determine 
the minimum and maximum of those 7 values. Design this function without using the idea of 
arrays or lists.  Send back to the function call the minimum and maximum value. (Hint, you 
should use no more than 7 comparisons to find the maximum and no more than 7 comparisons to 
find the minimum.) """
